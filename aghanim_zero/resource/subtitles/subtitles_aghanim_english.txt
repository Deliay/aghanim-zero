Soaked in the blood of the most dangerous foes Aghanim could conjure. It is now clear that you are worthy and capable of wielding my scepter. What is next for Aghanim, you ask? Well, let's not make this moment about me. But if you must know... ah, perhaps it is better left a secret. Until next time, heroes."
